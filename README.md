# SlimeVR-jojos38-PCB
A custom and fully featured PCB to make your own SlimeVR trackers!

It features:
- Ultra compact 38x38mm motherboard, perfect for 40mm batteries
- Autostop feature (the sensors will stop themselves after x minutes if they aren't used)
- Ultra efficient charger provides fast adjustable charge (0.25A to 2A with 0.25A increment adjustability)
- Ultra efficient buck-boost powering, providing more than 90% efficiency
- Two status LEDs, one for charging (green) and one for SlimeVR (orange)
- Compatible with almost all IMU including BNO's (**Untested but should work**)
- ESD protection for the USB and the power button
- Low heating while charging and working
- Ability to add temperature sensor for the battery (**Require modification of the PCB before ordering**)

**Important note**: The ESD diode schematic is WRONG by the person who made it, I should have fixed it on the new variant but it wasn't tested
